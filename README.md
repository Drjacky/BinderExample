# Binder Example ðŸ¤–

This is a simple Android application demonstrating the usage of low-level binder communication with coroutines, flows and channels.  
The app simulates reading data via a binder, processes responses, and updates the UI using Jetpack Compose.

## Features

- **Low-Level Binder Communication**: Simulates reading responses from a binder.
- **Coroutines, Flows and Channels**: Uses coroutines for background processing and flows and channels for reactive data handling.
- **Jetpack Compose UI**: Updates the UI with responses in real-time.
- **Lifecycle-Aware Collection**: Ensures proper handling of responses based on the lifecycle of the activity.

## Architecture

- **LowLevelBinder**: Simulates low-level binder communication by writing and reading data from parcels.
- **Communicator**: Manages the binder communication and emits responses using a `Channel` and a `Flow`.
- **MainActivity**: The main activity that initializes the communicator, collects responses, and updates the UI.
